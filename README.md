# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Using Retinal Fundus Imaging

This project predicts heart attack risk using retinal fundus images and deep learning techniques.

## Technologies
- Python
- CNN
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Flask

## Description
Developed a CNN-based deep learning model using retinal fundus images to predict heart attack risk. Image preprocessing and model training were performed to support early risk analysis.

## Note
This is an academic project developed for learning purposes.
